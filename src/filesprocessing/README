1. Design:
    1. We divided the project to packages. A package for filters, for orders, for factories and for
     exceptions. The packages are important for modularity and easy and specified import.
    2. FILTERS: all filters implement from a parent Filter. They divide to categories, Size filters,
     Contains filters and Property filters. This diviation helped preventing code duplication.
    3. ORDER: We used one Order class, that has a Comperator property. The comperator contains a "rule" for
     compering (Size, Type, Abs path etc.)
    4. FACTORIES: We created some factories, each one has specific purpose, one create Filters, one
     for Comperators, one for Command Sections (4 lines) and one that converts text to String array.
    5. EXCEPTIONS: We created two simple classes that implies exceptions, one for each type. Then we could
     catch each type of exception and react appropriately.

2. Exceptions:
    We have two types of exceptions: Type 1 and Type 2.
    The main function is wrapped with type 2 catcher. If a type 2 exception is thrown, the program is
     quited with error.
    Every filter and order command is wrapped with Type 1, so when an exception is thrown it displays an
     error and choose the default command.

3. We used an ArrayList. This data structure was convenient because we didn't have to specify it's size,
 and we also had the sort() method that helped us order the files.
